The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.
It is a plain-text protocol that uses as new line character <i>0x0d 0x0a</i> so sometimes you need to connect using <i>telnet</i> or <i>nc -C</i>.

# Default Port: 21

```shell
PORT   STATE SERVICE
21/tcp open  ftp
```

## Banner Grabbing


```bash
nc -vn <IP> 21
openssl s_client -connect crossfit.htb:21 -starttls ftp #Get certificate if any
```

<br>

## Connect to FTP using starttls


```shell
    lftp
    lftp :~> set ftp:ssl-force true
    lftp :~> set ssl:verify-certificate no
    lftp :~> connect 10.10.10.208
    lftp 10.10.10.208:~> login                       
    Usage: login <user|URL> [<pass>]
    lftp 10.10.10.208:~> login username Password
```

<br>

## Unauthenticated Enumeration:


 You can us the commands <i>HELP</i> and <i>FEAT</i> to obtain some information of the FTP server:

```bash

# Connections:


In Active FTP the FTP client first initiates the control connection from its port N to FTP Servers command port â€“ port 21. 

The client then listens to port N+1 and sends the port N+1 to FTP Server. 

FTP Server then initiates the data connection, from its port M to the port N+1 of the FTP Client.

But, if the FTP Client has a firewall setup that controls the incoming data connections from outside, then active FTP may be a problem. 

And, a feasible solution for that is Passive FTP.

In Passive FTP, the client initiates the control connection from its port N to the port 21 of FTP Server. 

After this, the client issues a passv comand. The server then sends the client one of its port number M. And the client initiates the data connection from its port P to port M of the FTP Server.

# Anonymous Login:



* anonymous : anonymous

* anonymous :

* ftp : ftp

```shell
  ftp <IP>
>anonymous
>anonymous
>ls -a # List all files (even hidden) (yes, they could be hidden)
>binary #Set transmission to binary instead of ascii
>ascii #Set transmission to ascii instead of binary
>bye #exit
```
<br>

# Bruteforcing:


A few useful wordlists for bruteforcing SSH have been provided below within the references section.

<br>

# Nmap:


Anon login and bounce FTP checks are perform by default by nmap with -sC option.


# Shodan:


```shell
    ftp
    port:21

```

<br>

# Browser Connection:


You can connect to a FTP server using a browser (like Firefox) using a URL like:

```bash
    ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.10.10.98
```


Note that if a web application is sending data controlled by a user directly to a FTP server you can send double URL encode %0d%0a (in double URL encode this is %250d%250a) bytes and make the FTP server perform arbitrary actions. One of this possible arbitrary actions is to download content from a users controlled server, perform port scanning or try to talk to other plain-text based services (like http).

# Download All Files From FTP:


```shell
wget -m ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.10.10.98 #Donwload all
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.10.10.98 #Download all
```

<br>

# Config Files:


```shell
ftpusers
ftp.conf
proftpd.conf
```
